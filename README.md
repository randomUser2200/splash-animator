# Splash Animator!

Animation tool with modern web standards for beginners

File size: 47 KB

This is an animation tool inspired by Flash (now obsolete) with modern web standards: a visual editor, minimal UI fluff, and a CSS editor.

The editor uses SVG under the hood so it enables vector-based elements, which don't change regardless of resolution. It includes a CSS editor (Monaco Editor-powered) for things that the visual editor doesn't include natively. The CSS editor is where animation magic kicks in.

There are links to CSS tutorials (MDN Web Docs, freeCodeCamp, W3Schools) for beginners.

There are basic shapes, text, and permission to import images. You can also export the scene to HTML to add things like audio, etc. (though I'm making a web app that helps do those things)

This was licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 to avoid SaaS lock-in. Splash Animator should be available anywhere, with it's source cracked open, for anyone to modify, to use, to redistribute under same license guidelines.
